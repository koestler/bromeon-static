  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my personal homepage. I am Jan, a C++ developer who is interested in the creation of games and game-related programming libraries. I use this site to share some of my  projects. </p>
  <h2>Thor 2.0</h2>
  <p><em>July 2015</em></p>
  <p><a href="libraries/thor/index.html">Thor 2.0</a> has finally been released, featuring massive improvements over Thor 1. Check it out!</p>
  <h2>Zloxx 2.3</h2>
  <p><em>May 2015</em></p>
  <p>Another iteration of the <a href="games/zloxx/index.html">little platformer Zloxx</a>, coming with fundamental improvements: scenery animations, smoother glow effects, acceleration physics, climax and ending screen, framerate stability...</p>
  <h2>Articles on C++ and Game Development</h2>
  <p><em>January 2014</em></p>
  <p><a href="articles/index.html">Articles</a> are a new section on my homepage. I will use them to share some insights about C++ and game development, and hope you find them useful! This is not a  blog, so  do not expect new articles in a regular manner.</p>
<h2>Zloxx 2.2</h2>
  <p><em>October 2013</em></p>
  <p>A new version of Zloxx II, the Jump'n'Run game, is now available. I have ported it to Linux and spent a lot of time to enhance the graphical appearance with a variety of new effects and improved textures. <a href="games/zloxx/index.html">More...</a></p>
  <h2>SFML Book released</h2>
  <p><em>June 2013</em></p>
  <p>The first book about SFML, which I authored together with two other guys, has been released! <strong>SFML Game Development</strong> covers the process of developing a top-scrolling aircraft shooter, using only the SFML library. <a href="book/index.html">More...</a></p>
  <h2>Zloxx II</h2>
  <p><em>July 2012</em></p>
  <p>A new game has been released! This time, you control a little character in a 2D Jump'n'Run and try to find your way through the levels. Check out the <a href="games/zloxx/index.html">Zloxx II page</a> for more information.</p>
  <h2>Thor 2 and Aurora</h2>
  <p><em>March 2012</em></p>
  <p>There is a couple of  news:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Thor's naming convention has been adapted to match SFML's. As an extension of the latter, this simplifies the combined usage of both libraries a lot. Eventually, the intention should consist of making Thor compatible to the final SFML 2.0 release.</li>
    <li> Functionality which isn't directly related to multimedia programming and SFML – such as smart pointers or dynamic dispatchers – has been outsourced into a separate library called <strong>Aurora</strong>. This split allows people to make use of those features independently of SFML, even without building anything.</li>
    <li>Both Aurora and Thor use now Git as revision control system. I have chosen GitHub to host the projects, the repositories can be found <a href="https://github.com/Bromeon">here</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As this is the time to break un-proven concepts and to refine the API design, I am really glad about any feedback concerning Aurora or Thor. As soon as the major tasks have been completed, I'll focus again on the realization of new features.</p>
<h2>Thor 1.1</h2>
  <p><em>March 2012</em></p>
  <p>Finally, another version with precompiled binaries has been released. This release aims to be compatible with SFML 2 before the new naming convention, for people  not wanting to adapt all their projects. Meanwhile, I am working on the next Thor version, where several parts are going to be changed.</p>
  <h2>Airport</h2>
<p><em>October 2011</em></p>
<p>For months, Thor has been the one and only topic of my homepage. But since I also occasionally develop games, the time has come to announce <a href="games/airport/index.html">Airport</a>. Your goal is to coordinate airplanes and to lead them savely to an airfield.</p>
<h2>Thor C++ Library</h2>
<p><em>April 2011</em></p>
<p>Version 1.0 of the Thor C++ Library has been released! Thor is a framework that provides advanced functionality on top of SFML. Click <a href="libraries/thor/index.html">here</a> for a detailed description.</p>
