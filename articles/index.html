<h1>Articles</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the site of articles on C++ and game development. With these articles, I am attempting to share some insights in various topics, and hope you enjoy them! The articles are written from my personal point of view, but I try to incorporate different opinions I have encountered over the past years, in order to give an overview which is as objective as possible. Nevertheless, there are  points which you may have experienced differently, so take it with a grain of salt ;)</p>
  <p>This is not a blog; new articles will appear in an irregular manner. At the moment, there is  one article which covers memory management in C++.</p>
