<h1>Book: SFML Game Development</h1>
  <p>In 2013, I was given the opportunity to write a book on the topic of SFML, the  multimedia library developed by Laurent Gomila.  I have worked with SFML since 2008. Over the years, I have been involved in many discussions around the library's design, giving me deeper insights into  development. Since the beginning of 2014, I'm also part of the SFML developer team.</p>
  <p>The book <em>SFML Game Development</em> was written with two other guys and explains the process of developing a full-fledged game using SFML. The target audience are programmers with experience in C++. No prior knowledge of game development is required, but the book uses several techniques that may also be interesting for experienced game developers.</p>
  <p>The book is divided in 10 chapters. Every chapter builds on top of the previous ones and comes with a separate code base, allowing readers to understand the code on-the-fly and to experiment with the game as they like. The following topics are covered:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Basics:</strong> introduction to SFML, game loop, time handling techniques, vector algebra</li>
    <li><strong>Resource management:</strong> loading textures from files, generalizing the approach to other resources, error handling</li>
    <li><strong>World:</strong> models to represent the game world and its entities, scene graphs, transforms, 2D views/cameras, world updates</li>
    <li><strong>User input:</strong> keyboard, mouse and joystick input,  a command system to distribute events</li>
    <li><strong>States:</strong> switching between menus and the game, pause, a state stack architecture</li>
    <li><strong>GUI:</strong> buttons, texts and other UI components, an interface to customize key bindings</li>
    <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> hitpoints, enemy AI, collision detection and response, bullets and homing missiles, power-ups, victory/defeat conditions</li>
    <li><strong>Visual effects:</strong> behind the scenes (OpenGL and low-level rendering), particle systems, animations, shaders</li>
    <li><strong>Audio:</strong> playing music  and sound effects, positioning sound in 3D space</li>
    <li><strong>Network:</strong> brief explanation of TCP, UDP and network architectures,  implementing server and client, packet handling, latency and synchronization, cheating prevention</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The game looks as follows:</p>
