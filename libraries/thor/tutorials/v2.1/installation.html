  <h1>Installation Tutorial</h1>
  <p>In this tutorial, I try to teach you how to  install Thor with the CMake build system and how to use it in your projects.</p>
  <h2>1. Compile SFML</h2>
  <p>Before you are able to build Thor, SFML must be compiled. Make sure that you use a recent Git revision that is compatible with Thor, a Git snapshot is provided on the download site. Use CMake to build and install SFML, there is a <a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.0/compile-with-cmake.php">tutorial</a> on the official SFML page.</p>
  <p>Build the SFML configurations you like to use, and create  static or dynamic libraries of the components system, window, graphics and audio.</p>
  <p><span class="important">Important:</span> Do not only compile SFML, but also <em>install</em> it. That means, you have to build the install target. You do that as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Visual Studio solutions:</strong> Compile the INSTALL project.</li>
    <li><strong>NMake:</strong> Execute <code>nmake install</code> in the VS command line.</li>
    <li><strong>Make:</strong> Type <code> make install</code> in the terminal.</li>
    <li><strong>MinGW</strong>: Type <code>mingw32-make install</code> in the command line.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>2. Configure Thor with CMake</h2>
  <p>I guess you already know CMake since SFML uses it, nevertheless I  show you some steps specific to this library.</p>
  <p>After cloning Thor from GitHub, run CMake. Here, I  only explain how to work with the graphical user interface (cmake-gui). Specify the source and build directory, click &quot;Configure&quot; and choose your generator. After configuring, this might happen:</p>
<img src="cmake1.png" />
<p>There occurs an error because Thor needs SFML and doesn't know where it is. Just set the SFML_ROOT variable to the root directory path of SFML (this was the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX during SFML build). There are several options to customize:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</strong> – Either &quot;Release&quot; or &quot;Debug&quot;</li>
  <li><strong>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</strong> – The directory which should contain the compiled libraries, include directories and maybe examples</li>
  <li><strong>THOR_BUILD_DOC</strong> – Specifies if the Doxygen documentation is generated</li>
  <li><strong>THOR_BUILD_EXAMPLES</strong> – Check the box if the example codes should be compiled</li>
  <li><strong>THOR_SHARED_LIBS</strong> – Enable to build shared/dynamic libraries, disable to build static libraries</li>
  <li><strong>THOR_STATIC_STD_LIBS</strong> – Enable to link compiler-specific CRT  and standard libraries statically (usually not recommended)</li>
</ul>
<p> Press &quot;Configure&quot; and choose the options according to your needs. In this example,  <code>C:/C++Libs</code> is the path where all the include, lib, bin folders are located. Thus, this is the SFML_ROOT directory. Because I want Thor's include and binary files to be installed in this directory, too, the CMAKE_INSTALL_DIR contains the same path. The CMake window now looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="cmake2.png" /></p>
<p>Click &quot;Generate&quot;, go to the build directory and build the project.</p>
<h2>3. Link and compile Thor</h2>
<p>As soon as your libraries are built, you can use Thor in your projects. The generated libraries have the following naming scheme:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="250"><strong>Dynamic Linkage, Release</strong></td>		
    <td>thor</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Dynamic Linkage, Debug</strong></td>	<td>thor-d</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Static Linkage, Release</strong></td>		<td>thor-s</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Static Linkage, Debug</strong></td>		<td>thor-s-d</td></tr>
</tr>
</table>
<p>If necessary, add the library prefixes ("lib") and file extensions (".lib", ".dll", ".so") corresponding to your platform and compiler.</p>
<p>When you link statically, you have to  add <strong>SFML_STATIC</strong> to your project's preprocessor definitions.</p>
<p>If you compile with g++, you need to add the compiler flag <code>-std=c++0x</code>. On Linux, you should not forget to call <code>ldconfig</code> (possibly using <code>sudo</code>) in order to update the  paths so that the binaries are found.</p>
